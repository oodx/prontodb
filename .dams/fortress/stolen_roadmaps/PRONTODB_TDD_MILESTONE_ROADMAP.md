# 🦫 TEDDY'S TYRANNICAL TDD MILESTONE ROADMAP
*Stolen from project planning and secured in beaver treasure vaults*
*Systematically hoarded for milestone-based treasure release*

## 🏗️ PROJECT FOUNDATION
**RSB-compliant single-binary string-only key-value store CLI**
- Built on SQLite with zero daemons
- Hierarchical namespaces with TTL-aware caches
- Stream processing with meta-directives
- Optional filesystem mirroring

## 🎯 MILESTONE TREASURE SYSTEM

### 🔒 **MILESTONE 1: TDD Foundation** 
**Treasure Cards**: CARD_001 → CARD_008
**Quality Gate**: RSB compliance + TDD RED-GREEN cycles established
**Total Story Points**: 28 SP

**Critical Tasks** (with SP sizing):
- [ ] Fix config_tests.rs complex type violations (8 SP) - HIGH PRIORITY
  - Convert Config struct tests to string functions (3 SP)
  - Convert ConfigError tests to string outputs (3 SP)
  - Test `do_*` functions, not internal structs (2 SP)
- [ ] Fix integration.rs RSB pattern violations (8 SP)
  - Replace std::env with RSB patterns (3 SP)
  - Replace std::fs with RSB operations (3 SP)
  - Replace std::process with shell ops (2 SP)
- [ ] Establish RED-GREEN cycle discipline (5 SP)
  - Document TDD workflow (2 SP)
  - Create TDD templates (3 SP)
- [ ] Update test runner configuration (3 SP)
- [ ] Pass all existing tests with TDD patterns (4 SP)

**Treasure Release Criteria**:
- ✅ All YAP violations resolved
- ✅ TDD cycles documented for each fix
- ✅ RedRover compliance verification passed
- ✅ Integration tests pass with RSB patterns

### 🔒 **MILESTONE 2: Core KV Operations**
**Treasure Cards**: CARD_006 → CARD_012
**Quality Gate**: Basic CRUD operations with streaming auth

**Feature Development**:
- [ ] Core KV commands (set, get, del, keys, scan)
- [ ] Namespace management (projects, namespaces, nss)
- [ ] Basic auth system (admin/pronto! default)
- [ ] Stream processing with meta-directives
- [ ] Exit code standards (0=success, 2=miss/expired)

**Engineering Standards**:
- [ ] TDD for each new function
- [ ] RSB string-first patterns
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Integration test coverage

### 🔒 **MILESTONE 3: TTL & Cache System**
**Treasure Cards**: CARD_013 → CARD_020
**Quality Gate**: Time-based expiration with lazy cleanup

**Cache Features**:
- [ ] TTL namespace creation (`admin create-cache`)
- [ ] Lazy expiry on read/write operations
- [ ] `--include-expired` flag implementation
- [ ] Cache configuration management
- [ ] Eviction policies (max_items, evict_on_read)

**Performance Requirements**:
- [ ] Near-SQLite performance benchmarks
- [ ] Memory efficiency validation
- [ ] Concurrent access testing

### 🔒 **MILESTONE 4: Security & Auth**
**Treasure Cards**: CARD_021 → CARD_028
**Quality Gate**: Complete auth system with API keys

**Security Implementation**:
- [ ] Stream auth preamble enforcement
- [ ] User management system
- [ ] Session tokens (v0.2 feature)
- [ ] API key generation and validation
- [ ] Configurable security policies
- [ ] Encryption delegation to system tools

**Security Testing**:
- [ ] Auth bypass prevention
- [ ] Input validation security
- [ ] Stream injection protection

### 🔒 **MILESTONE 5: Data Management**
**Treasure Cards**: CARD_029 → CARD_035
**Quality Gate**: Complete backup/restore with export capabilities

**Data Operations**:
- [ ] Backup system with optional encryption
- [ ] TSV import/export functionality
- [ ] Database integrity validation
- [ ] Migration utilities
- [ ] Data compression options

**Reliability Testing**:
- [ ] Backup restoration verification
- [ ] Large dataset import/export
- [ ] Corruption recovery procedures

### 🔒 **MILESTONE 6: Filesystem Mirror (v0.3)**
**Treasure Cards**: CARD_036 → CARD_042
**Quality Gate**: Bidirectional fs sync with grep-friendly exploration

**Mirror Features**:
- [ ] `export-fs` directory mapping
- [ ] `import-fs` synchronization
- [ ] Context suffix handling (`__italian` → `/italian/`)
- [ ] File format management (JSON default)
- [ ] Incremental sync capabilities

**Integration Requirements**:
- [ ] `grep`/`rg` compatibility
- [ ] File system watch integration
- [ ] Conflict resolution policies

## 🦫 TREASURE RELEASE PROTOCOL

### Quality Gate Requirements
**Each milestone requires**:
1. ✅ All treasure cards completed with TDD evidence
2. ✅ RedRover RSB compliance verification
3. ✅ Integration test coverage ≥ 90%
4. ✅ Documentation updated
5. ✅ Performance benchmarks met
6. ✅ Security review passed (M4+)

### Card Distribution System
**Beaver Hoarding Rules**:
- Only 1 active treasure card released per developer at a time
- Next card requires TDD evidence from previous card
- Milestone completion unlocks batch card release
- Emergency cards available for critical fixes only

### TDD Evidence Requirements
**For each treasure card**:
- [ ] RED: Failing test written first
- [ ] GREEN: Minimum code to pass test
- [ ] REFACTOR: Code cleaned while tests remain green
- [ ] Documentation: Function behavior documented
- [ ] Integration: Feature integrated with existing system

### Beaver Security Measures
- **Password Protection**: All milestone vaults ZIP encrypted
- **Backup Paranoia**: Duplicate treasure storage in AGENTIC_ETC/
- **Access Control**: Treasure release only via proper TDD cycles
- **Quality Tyranny**: No shortcuts allowed past quality gates
- **Card Rationing**: Single-card discipline enforced

## 🚨 TYRANNICAL ENFORCEMENT NOTES

**BEAVER DECREE**: This roadmap represents the COMPLETE treasure map for ProntoDB development. Any attempt to bypass milestone gates, skip TDD evidence, or access unreleased cards will be met with AGGRESSIVE TAIL SLAPPING and FORTRESS LOCKDOWN.

**QUALITY PROMISE**: Each milestone delivers production-ready, thoroughly tested, RSB-compliant code that advances toward the complete ProntoDB vision.

**TREASURE GUARANTEE**: Developers following this systematic approach will receive steady card releases, clear progress markers, and the satisfaction of building something truly excellent.
