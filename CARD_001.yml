# BEAVER ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL:
# Phase 1 (RED): Verify failing test - run `cargo test test_rsb_param_expansion` to confirm failure
# Phase 2 (GREEN): Fix test environment setup with minimal viable code
# Phase 3 (REFACTOR): Improve test robustness and environment handling
# Commit Format: "TDD [PHASE]: [description] - CARD_001"
# NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED - Full beaver verification at each phase!
