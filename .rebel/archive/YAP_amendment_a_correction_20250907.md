# ðŸ¦Š RSB AMENDMENT A CORRECTION YAP
**Date**: 2025-09-07
**Target**: Amendment A implementation attempt
**Issue Type**: MACRO VISIBILITY LIMITATION

## AMENDMENT A IMPLEMENTATION FAILURE ðŸš¨

**Problem**: Removed RSB prelude imports from module files per Amendment A, but compilation failed with 56 macro resolution errors:

```
error: cannot find macro `param` in this scope
error: cannot find macro `test` in this scope  
error: cannot find macro `validate` in this scope
error: cannot find type `Args` in this scope
```

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS ðŸ“š

**Rust Macro System Limitation**: Unlike functions, Rust macros require explicit imports in each module that uses them. The `use rsb::prelude::*` import from main.rs does NOT make macros available to other modules through standard module inheritance.

**Amendment A Gap**: The Amendment assumed Rust module inheritance would work for macros, but this is incorrect for the current RSB implementation.

## CORRECTIVE ACTION âš¡

**REVERT CHANGES** - Restore RSB prelude imports to modules that use RSB macros:

1. **config.rs**: Restore `use rsb::prelude::*;` (uses param!, test!, validate!, etc.)
2. **core.rs**: Restore `use rsb::prelude::*;` (uses param!, require_var!, validate!)  
3. **utils.rs**: Can remain without RSB import (no RSB macro usage found)
4. **handlers.rs**: Restore `use rsb::prelude::*;` (uses Args type)

**CLARIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT A**: 
- Only modules that DON'T use RSB macros can omit the prelude import
- Modules using RSB functionality require explicit RSB imports due to Rust macro system

## TERRITORIAL STATUS ðŸ¦Š
Amendment A needs refinement to account for Rust macro visibility rules. Current ProntoDB implementation with multiple RSB imports is CORRECT for modules that use RSB functionality.

**LESSON**: Territory laws must account for the underlying system's limitations
