üêî China's Analysis of: /home/xnull/repos/code/rust/oodx/prontodb/specs/ABRIDGED-SDLC.md
üìù Target: Development Process Document (Adapted from Boxy project)

EXECUTIVE CLUCK üêî
=================
This "Wild Way" SDLC blends surgical precision with adaptive flexibility - designed for restoration/healing work rather than greenfield development. Originally crafted for the Boxy project, it emphasizes disciplined scope control and test-driven healing over bureaucratic processes.

PROCESS PHASES & PURPOSE üìä
============================

1. **Session Setup (5 min)**
   - Purpose: Establish safe working environment with isolation branch
   - Key Activities: Branch creation, current state verification, scope definition
   - Gate: Pre-flight checklist completion

2. **State Assessment (15 min)**
   - Purpose: Document actual problems vs assumptions
   - Key Activities: Evidence gathering, test failure analysis, dependency mapping
   - Gate: Clear understanding of what's actually broken

3. **Test-Driven Healing (Core Session)**
   - Purpose: Systematic restoration using TDD principles
   - Key Activities: Test creation, minimal fixes, checkpoint commits
   - Gate: Each component individually verified and committed

4. **Session Completion**
   - Purpose: Verify overall system health and document progress
   - Key Activities: Full test suite run, progress documentation, final commit
   - Gate: All tests green, progress documented

QUALITY GATES & CHECKPOINTS ‚úÖ
===============================

**Pre-Session Gates:**
- Isolation branch created from stable state
- Build green (cargo build && cargo test --lib)
- Test system functional
- Scope clearly defined

**During-Session Checkpoints:**
- After each meaningful healing step ‚Üí commit
- Test passes for right reason ‚Üí proceed
- Build stays green ‚Üí continue
- Scope discipline maintained ‚Üí advance

**Post-Session Gates:**
- All tests passing (cargo test --all)
- Progress documented in session-notes.md
- Final commit with summary
- STATUS.md updated with true current state

**Quality Verification Commands:**
- `cargo build` - Compilation verification
- `cargo test --lib` - Unit test verification  
- `cargo test --all` - Full test suite
- `git status` - Change tracking

EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS üö®
=======================

**Priority 0: Build Recovery**
1. Fix compilation errors ONLY
2. No feature work until build green
3. Commit each compilation fix atomically
4. Document what caused the break
5. THEN proceed to other fixes

**Priority 1: Test System Recovery**  
1. Identify what broke the test infrastructure
2. Create minimal test that should pass
3. Fix ONLY test infrastructure components
4. Verify test system functional again
5. THEN proceed with feature restoration

**Scope Creep Emergency Protocol:**
- STOP immediately when hearing: "While I'm here...", "This would be better if...", "I should refactor this..."
- Document the improvement idea for future session
- Return to defined scope boundaries
- Krex's Gate: Ruthless scope enforcement

SESSION COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ‚úîÔ∏è
===================================

**Technical Completion:**
- All tests passing (cargo test --all)
- Build remains green throughout
- Each checkpoint commit meaningful and atomic
- No broken functionality introduced

**Documentation Completion:**
- session-notes.md updated with:
  * Fixed items (specific list)
  * Remaining items (for next session)
  * Patterns learned
- STATUS.md reflects true current state
- Technical debt documented, not ignored

**Process Completion:**
- Scope stayed within defined boundaries
- Progress measurable and verifiable
- Team can build and verify changes confidently

ADAPTATIONS NEEDED FOR PRONTODB ü¶Ä
===================================

**FROM BOXY-SPECIFIC TO RUST/RSB:**

1. **Build Commands Adaptation:**
   ```bash
   # Boxy used cargo commands - ProntoDB likely same
   # BUT verify RSB-specific build requirements:
   cargo build --release --features rsb
   # May need RSB-specific feature flags
   ```

2. **Test Strategy Adaptation:**
   ```rust
   // Boxy focused on theme/UI restoration
   // ProntoDB needs database/protocol testing:
   #[test]
   fn test_pronoto_protocol_integration() {
       // RSB-specific protocol tests
   }
   
   #[test] 
   fn test_database_connection_healing() {
       // Database-specific restoration tests
   }
   ```

3. **Branch Naming Adaptation:**
   ```bash
   # Current: features/broken-v8, features/repairs-v8
   # ProntoDB might need:
   features/db-repairs-v1
   features/protocol-fixes-v1
   features/rsb-integration-v1
   ```

4. **Tool Integration Updates:**
   ```markdown
   # Replace Boxy-specific tooling:
   - Remove references to "Lucas (Engineering) Mode"
   - Add RSB-specific development tools
   - Include database migration commands
   - Add protocol testing commands
   ```

RSB-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS NOT COVERED üîß
==========================================

**Missing RSB Protocol Considerations:**
1. **Protocol Version Management:**
   - No mention of RSB protocol version compatibility
   - Need checkpoints for protocol changes
   - Version migration testing requirements

2. **Database State Management:**
   - No database backup/restore procedures for safe experimentation
   - Missing database migration rollback protocols
   - No mention of data integrity verification

3. **Network Protocol Testing:**
   - Missing network isolation testing
   - No mention of protocol regression testing
   - Missing integration testing with external RSB systems

4. **Performance Constraints:**
   - No mention of performance regression testing
   - Missing memory usage monitoring during restoration
   - No database query performance verification

**Additional RSB Requirements:**
- Database schema version checking before/after sessions
- Protocol compatibility matrix verification
- Network connectivity testing as part of pre-flight checklist
- RSB-specific logging and monitoring during healing sessions

**Suggested RSB Additions to SDLC:**
```bash
# Pre-flight additions for ProntoDB:
rsb protocol --version-check
pronoto db --health-check
cargo test --features rsb-integration

# Post-session additions:
rsb protocol --regression-test
pronoto db --integrity-check
```

ADAPTATION PRIORITY MATRIX üéØ
=============================

**HIGH PRIORITY (Immediate Needs):**
- Replace Boxy build commands with RSB-specific ones
- Add database backup/restore to emergency protocols
- Include RSB protocol testing in quality gates

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Soon):**
- Develop RSB-specific test templates
- Create database migration rollback procedures
- Add network protocol regression testing

**LOW PRIORITY (Eventually):**
- Integrate RSB-specific monitoring tools
- Develop performance regression testing
- Create RSB protocol version management workflows

DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è
=============
This analysis reflects the content of the ABRIDGED-SDLC.md file as reviewed. The actual state of ProntoDB development processes, RSB integration requirements, or current project needs may differ. Additional verification against actual project requirements, current tooling, and team practices is recommended before implementing these adaptations.

üêî Bawk bawk! Hope this egg helps you establish disciplined development practices for ProntoDB! The SDLC looks solid but definitely needs some RSB-specific seasoning to be truly effective for your project.
