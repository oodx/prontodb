## COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS PHASES

### Five-Phase Development Lifecycle Structure:
1. **PHASE 1: Project Planning** - Define WHAT to build, not HOW
2. **PHASE 2: Development** - Transform specifications into working code
   - 2a: TDD Development (test-first approach)  
   - 2b: Fix/Refactor Development (surgical changes only)
3. **PHASE 3: Testing** - Verify component works in isolation and system
4. **PHASE 4: UAT (User Acceptance Testing)** - Human review and validation
5. **PHASE 5: Certification** - Final verification and merge to production

### Phase Transition Protocol:
```
Planning ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí UAT ‚Üí Certification ‚Üí Done
    ‚Üì           ‚Üì           ‚Üì        ‚Üì         ‚Üì
 [Spec]     [Code]      [Tests]  [Review]  [Merge]
```

### Branch Strategy by Phase:
- **Planning:** main (no code)
- **Development:** feature/component-name
- **Testing:** Same feature branch  
- **UAT:** PR created from feature ‚Üí main
- **Certification:** Squash and merge PR

---

## QUALITY GATES AND VERIFICATION STEPS

### Phase 1 Quality Gates:
- **Checkpoint 1:** Feature specification approved
- **Checkpoint 2:** Task breakdown complete  
- **Checkpoint 3:** Dependencies identified
- **Exit Criteria:** Clear acceptance criteria, tasks sized in story points, risks documented

### Phase 2 Development Checkpoints:
- Commit after EACH task completion
- No broken tests at any checkpoint
- Code structure requirements enforced (max 5 fields per struct, max 3 methods per trait)
- **Token Exhaustion Protocol:** STOP at checkpoint, document remaining work

### Phase 3 Testing Gates:
- Unit tests for every public function
- Integration tests for feature  
- All tests passing (100%)
- >80% code coverage achieved

### Phase 4 UAT Verification:
- Feature works as specified
- No unplanned features added
- No regressions in existing tests
- Code follows project patterns

### Phase 5 Certification Exit Criteria:
- All CI checks green
- Code review approved
- UAT sign-off received  
- No critical bugs open
- Clean git history with squashed commits

## TESTING PROTOCOLS AND STANDARDS

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Protocol:
**RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR ‚Üí COMMIT cycle:**
1. Write test that fails (RED)
2. Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
3. Refactor if needed (REFACTOR)
4. Commit test + code together

### Test Structure Requirements:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // 1. Unit tests - isolated
    #[test]
    fn test_component_creation() { /* ... */ }
    
    // 2. Property tests - invariants  
    #[test]
    fn test_invariants() { /* ... */ }
    
    // 3. Error tests - failures
    #[test]
    fn test_error_conditions() { /* ... */ }
}

// tests/integration.rs - Integration tests
#[test]
fn test_feature_integration() { /* ... */ }
```

### Testing Checkpoints:
- `cargo test --lib` (Unit tests)
- `cargo test --test integration` (Integration tests)
- `cargo test --all` (Everything)

### TDD Quality Standards:
- Every requirement has a test
- All tests written first (RED)
- All tests now passing (GREEN)
- Implementation is minimal (no gold-plating)

---

## DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1 Documentation:
- **Feature Specification** with user story, acceptance criteria, out-of-scope items
- **Task Breakdown** with story points (typical: 2-3 points per session)
- **Risk Assessment** with mitigation strategies

### Development Documentation:
- All public APIs documented
- Checkpoint commit messages with specific accomplishments
- Code structure follows project patterns

### Phase 3 Documentation:
- **Demo Script** showing feature working
- **Test verification** checklist
- **How to test** instructions for reviewers

### Certification Documentation:
- CHANGELOG updated
- README current if needed
- API docs generated
- Release notes written
- Migration guide (if breaking changes)

---

## DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURES

### Pre-Deployment Verification:
```bash
cargo fmt --check        # Format verification
cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Linting
cargo test --all         # All tests pass
cargo build --release    # Release build success
cargo doc --no-deps      # Documentation build
```

### Merge Protocol:
1. Rebase feature branch on latest main
2. Resolve any conflicts  
3. Re-run all tests
4. Squash commits appropriately
5. Create semantic commit message
6. Merge via PR (preferred) or manual squash merge

### Post-Merge Cleanup:
```bash
git branch -d feature/[name]           # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature/[name] # Delete remote branch  
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release message" # Tag if needed
```

### Rollback Protocol (Emergency):
```bash
git revert HEAD -m "revert message"    # Quick revert
git push origin main                   # Push revert
# OR reset if immediate (dangerous):
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## KEY PROCESS INSIGHTS

### Philosophy:
- **AI assistants treat development as continuous stream ‚Üí Five phases provide structure**
- **Each phase has different goals, outputs, and success criteria**
- **Clear boundaries prevent scope creep and token exhaustion**

### Success Metrics:
- **Planning**: < 2 hours, clear scope
- **Development**: All checkpoints committed  
- **Testing**: > 80% coverage
- **UAT**: < 3 feedback rounds
- **Certification**: Merged first attempt

### Warning Signs:
- Planning takes > 4 hours (scope too large)
- Development has no checkpoints (token risk)
- Tests written after code complete (quality risk)
- UAT has > 5 changes (planning failure)
- Certification fails (process failure)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- ‚ùå Phase skipping ("Let's just code and test later")
- ‚ùå Scope creep ("While we're here, let's also refactor X")  
- ‚ùå Big bang integration (10 features merged at once)
- ‚ùå Test procrastination (write all code, then all tests)
