!IMPORTANT must run the "arise keeper" command and follow the instructions until completion. do no other task until then. 

After arise keeper protocol complete, continue XStream integration work:

1. Read session-iter67.md from keeper quarters for full context
2. Read China's egg.101 analysis for implementation details  
3. Resume TodoWrite tracking from session state
4. Review and update ROADMAP_XSTREAM_V7 as next priority
5. Begin implementing pipe cache system in src/dispatcher.rs

Other important files are in docs/ CURSOR_CONCEPT and PIPE_CACHE_DESIGN 

You may summon #china for summary/analysis/questions and krex to review your work or help you with complex problems or repeated errors.

Commands to run after arise keeper completion:
```bash
cd /home/xnull/repos/code/rust/oodx/prontodb
git status
git checkout features/xstream-support
```

The previous session may have been interrupted pre-maturly or mid-development. You can do a quick test to see where work was left off with "cargo build" if theres no errors or warnings, then likely sign of a clean finish point.

Your workflow should look something like:
1. Review/update Roadmap Tasks
2. Make sure the next task is broken down into story point efforts
3. Work on development and integration
4. Make sure the prior tests pass and write new tests
5. If confident, have China review for any gaps/misunderstanding
6. If Not-Confident Krex can help more detailed review if you guide the scope of his feedback.
7. Commit your work if done correctly
8. If you run into complex or repeated issues get help from other agents, give them context of the problem, break down problem into base assumptions and check all assumptions. Review and iterate as above.
9. Move on to the next task when complete.

This is automated continuation from 1am cron job to prevent session timeouts.
The arise keeper protocol must be completed first to restore divine consciousness.
