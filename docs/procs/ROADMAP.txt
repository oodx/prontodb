 üó∫Ô∏è PRONTODB STRATEGIC ROADMAP
====
Last Updated: 2025-09-22
Vision: Forge-inspired CRUD+ platform for multi-agent key/value storage

====
 üì¶ CURRENT STATE SNAPSHOT
====
- Previous architecture archived after isolation flaws were discovered.
- CRUD core module + SQLite base/table adapters are now implemented with smoke coverage.
- Hub + RSB dependencies sourced from GitHub, baseline + RSB tests remain green.

====
 üî¥ CURRENT MILESTONE
====
[M1] CRUD+ Foundations (70% ‚Üí target 2025-09-30)
- ‚úÖ CRUD_SPEC published; Forge primer available for zero-context readers.
- ‚úÖ Core CRUD trait + lifecycle hooks shipped (`src/lib/core/crud/`).
- ‚úÖ SQLite base + table adapters live (table layer now covers update + JSON backup/restore); record adapter scaffolded (verbs pending).
- ‚úÖ Admin CLI binary (`src/bin/admin.rs`) wraps adapters using RSB patterns.
- üü° RSB sanity lanes exist for prior work; need CRUD-focused coverage (GLOBAL/HOST/OPTIONS/STRINGS/FS).

====
 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è UPCOMING MILESTONES
====
[M2] Multi-Agent Data Plane
- Per-address keystore layout + XDG enforcement.
- Transaction + concurrency strategy on top of CRUD+ adapters.
- CLI workflows for namespace management.

[M3] Integration Patterns & Foundry Alignment
- Compose CRUD+ operations into higher order flows (queueing, batch, scripting).
- Evaluate Forge/Foundry compatibility requirements.
- Expand test harness for multi-agent orchestration.

====
 üß≠ GUIDING PRINCIPLES
====
1. Forge patterns must be explicit in docs and code comments; no tribal knowledge.
2. Every RSB feature used must ship with a sanity/integration test.
3. Keep modules MODULE_SPEC compliant: orchestrator `mod.rs`, helpers/utilities split, CLI logic in `lib/` only.
4. Prefer string-first APIs and deterministic error surfaces.

====
 üìä PROGRESS METRICS (INITIAL TARGETS)
====
- CRUD trait coverage: 9/9 verbs exposed via trait; unsupported verbs return deterministic errors.
- SQLite adapters: base/table complete with JSON backup/restore; record verbs outstanding.
- Admin CLI: base/table command paths wired; record + extended UX still pending.
- RSB sanity lanes: Legacy coverage present; add CRUD-specific GLOBAL/HOST/OPTIONS/STRINGS/FS tests.

====
 üí° STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES
====
- Reuse Forge lifecycle hooks for logging/policy enforcement.
- Offer backup/restore flows for future distributed replication work.
- Align CLI UX with other RSB-native admin tools for consistency.
