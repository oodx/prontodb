 <¯ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================
XStream v7 Implementation Status: 82% COMPLETE

= KEY FINDINGS:
- XStream integration is noted as "82% complete" in the TODO.md
- No dedicated XStream roadmap file was found
- Implementation appears to be part of a larger meta-namespace strategy

================================================================================
 =Ê COMPLETION BREAKDOWN
================================================================================
COMPLETED FEATURES:
 Transparent Meta Namespace Integration
 Enterprise Multi-Tenancy Support
 Dynamic Context Switching
 Backward Compatibility Preservation
 Core System Production-Ready

PENDING ITEMS:
=' Final XStream Integration Polishing (18% remaining)
=' Potential Performance Optimizations
=' Additional Administrative Commands

================================================================================
 =€ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
================================================================================
- Core Functionality: 100% 
- Meta Namespace System: 100% 
- Enterprise Features: 100% 
- XStream Integration: 82% 

================================================================================
 =, DETAILED OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================
1. The project has achieved a "LEVEL3 PUBLIC" certification
2. All core unit tests (57/57) and meta namespace tests (17/17) are passing
3. The architecture supports transparent 4-layer addressing
4. Enterprise-grade security model is confirmed working

================================================================================
 S REMAINING QUESTIONS
================================================================================
- What specific features comprise the final 18% of XStream integration?
