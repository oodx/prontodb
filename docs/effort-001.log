seed prompt: here the prontodb project is stalled, we had some problems trying to enforce a tdd approach and the project had failed, recently codex began corrective work to set the project right so the new PRD, ROADMAP, TASKS in project root aim to create a simpler MVP to expand more advanced features from. all the docs/ present historic attempts and guidance at creating prontodb which is a rust layer on top of sqlite to create a namespaced kv store, using a  data-first approach to inter-cli communication (we use bash streams to share data and implement tokenstreams,   you can see the spec and library for this in adjacent project oodx/xstream, also oodx/rebel/docs/ref houses the rsb reference for the rebel/rsb library and framework which we want to try to leverage however possible), in any    case you can use china to summarize documents and codes in her .eggs/ directory, and redrover to validate for   rsb/rebel architecture non-compliance (his feedback is pretty heavy handed so you have to triage his feedback sometimes for validity before sharing it with devs) any developer agents on this project will need to have sufficient understanding so they can read china's summary eggs once shes completed them. you can also ask her to summarize the rebel/rsb framework and store her eggs for that here. She can review any repo. This tool is a critical cross-agent communication system so getting the initial MVP up and working is important. We also need to make sure we have  proper test coverage for confidence, and devs must commit after every stage of work. You have access to agents Lucas solid engineer, Krex hardening/correctness validator and Edgar security. For Krex and Edgar you need to temper them by explaining the nature of the feedback you need or they can be exhuberant in their demands, focus them on mvp level expectations

our session was interrupted, we have since completed the original mvp scope you were in the process of fixing the deploy script (our standard shell tool). please review status and continue
