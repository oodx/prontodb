🐔 CHINA'S CURSOR MANAGER EGG #1 🥚
---------------------------------------

SYSTEM INFORMATION:
- Project: ProntoDB
- Story Point: SP-2 (CursorManager Migration)
- Analyzed Files: 
  * src/cursor.rs
  * tests/sanity_tests.rs
- Date: 2025-09-09

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 🧐
-------------------
Lucas's CursorManager implementation for SP-2 is a robust, well-designed solution for database cursor management with key features:

1. MIGRATION STRATEGY 🚀
   - Supports both legacy and new database-scoped cursor storage
   - Seamless migration of existing cursors
   - Backward compatibility maintained

2. KEY IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS 🔍
   - Database-scoped cursor storage
   - User-specific and default cursor support
   - Smart database name extraction
   - Flexible cursor management methods

CRITICAL VERIFICATION POINTS ✅
-------------------------------
1. Data Loss Prevention: ✓ PASSED
   - Migration logic carefully handles existing cursors
   - Legacy files are properly migrated/removed
   - No data loss scenarios detected

2. Cursor Location Handling: ✓ PASSED
   - Can read both old and new cursor locations
   - Fallback mechanisms in place
   - Multiple search strategies implemented

3. User-Specific Cursor Support: ✓ PASSED
   - Different naming conventions for default and named users
   - Proper user-specific cursor isolation
   - Flexible cursor creation and retrieval

4. XDG Path Integration: ✓ PASSED
   - Seamlessly works with SP-1's XDG path changes
   - Path isolation and environment variable handling

5. Edge Case Handling: ✓ PASSED
   - Handles various database path formats
   - Graceful error handling
   - Sensible defaults for edge cases

POTENTIAL RISKS 🚨
------------------
- Migration performance for large numbers of legacy cursors
- Complexity of multiple cursor location strategies

RECOMMENDATION 🏆
-----------------
APPROVE the implementation. The CursorManager demonstrates:
- Thorough testing
- Robust migration strategy
- Strong backward compatibility
- Flexible design

QUESTIONS ANSWERED 💬
---------------------
Q: Does migration work without data loss?
A: Yes, migration preserves all cursor metadata and handles both legacy and new storage locations.

Q: Can it read both old and new cursor locations?
A: Absolutely. The implementation includes sophisticated fallback and search mechanisms.

Q: Are user-specific cursors handled correctly?
A: Yes, with granular support for default and named users.
