# ProntoDB MVP Status Report

Generated: 2025-09-08

## Project Status: ✅ **OPERATIONAL MVP**

The ProntoDB project has been successfully restored to a working state with all core MVP functionality implemented and tested.

## ✅ **Completed Work**

### 1. **Critical Issue Resolution**
- ✅ Fixed compilation errors in `main.rs` and `dispatcher.rs`
- ✅ Resolved missing module imports and RSB macro usage
- ✅ All tests now pass (21/21 successful)
- ✅ Manual functionality testing confirmed working

### 2. **RSB Integration**
- ✅ Implemented standard RSB main entry pattern with `args!()` and `pre_dispatch!()`
- ✅ Added lifecycle command support (install/uninstall/backup)
- ✅ Maintained string-biased API design throughout
- ✅ Documented RSB usage patterns in `docs/RSB_USAGE.md`

### 3. **Knowledge Documentation**
- ✅ China has created 10 summary eggs covering:
  - Project vision, requirements, and milestones
  - Technical architecture and success criteria
  - Complete RSB framework reference and compliance guidance
- ✅ All summaries stored in `.eggs/` for cross-agent communication

### 4. **Code Quality**
- ✅ All core CRUD operations working (set/get/del/keys/scan)
- ✅ TTL namespace support implemented and tested
- ✅ Discovery commands implemented (projects/namespaces)
- ✅ Proper exit code handling (0=success, 2=miss, 1=error)
- ✅ XDG path compliance with environment variable support

## 📊 **Current Feature Status**

| Milestone | Feature | Status | Tests |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| **M0** | CLI basics & help | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |
| **M0** | Addressing & validation | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |
| **M0** | Command dispatch | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |
| **M0** | XDG paths | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |
| **M1** | Core KV (set/get/del) | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |
| **M1** | Keys/scan operations | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |
| **M1** | Exit codes | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |
| **M2** | TTL namespace creation | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |
| **M2** | TTL rule enforcement | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |
| **M2** | Lazy expiry | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |
| **M3** | Discovery commands | ✅ Complete | ✅ Pass |

## 🧪 **Test Coverage**

```
cargo test
running 21 tests
test result: ok. 21 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored

✅ Unit tests: 10/10 passing
✅ Integration tests: 3/3 passing  
✅ Sanity tests: 8/8 passing
```

## 🚀 **Functionality Verification**

Manual testing confirms all core operations work:

```bash
# Basic operations
cargo run -- -p test -n demo set mykey myvalue  # ✅ Success
cargo run -- -p test -n demo get mykey          # ✅ Returns: myvalue
cargo run -- -p test -n demo del mykey          # ✅ Success
cargo run -- -p test -n demo get mykey          # ✅ Exit code: 2 (MISS)

# Discovery
cargo run -- projects                           # ✅ Lists projects
cargo run -- -p test namespaces                 # ✅ Lists namespaces

# Help system  
cargo run -- help                               # ✅ Shows usage
```

## 📋 **Architecture Quality**

### RSB Compliance
- **High**: Main entry, argument processing, string-biased APIs
- **Pragmatic**: Custom dispatcher for CLI-specific needs
- **Documented**: Clear examples for team learning

### Code Organization
- **Clean**: Proper module separation (api/storage/addressing/xdg)
- **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage across all modules
- **Maintainable**: Simple, direct implementations

## 🔧 **Technical Debt & Maintenance**

### Minor Issues Addressed
- ✅ Cleaned up temporary test files in `/tmp`
- ✅ Proper TempDir usage prevents cleanup issues
- ✅ Compiler warnings are non-critical (unused variables/functions)

### Future Maintenance Notes
- Consider cargo fix for remaining warnings
- Stream operations are properly stubbed for post-MVP implementation
- TTL functionality could be expanded with active expiry (currently lazy)

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Development Teams**

### For New Developers
1. Review China's summary eggs in `.eggs/` directory
2. Study `docs/RSB_USAGE.md` for RSB integration patterns
3. Run tests to understand expected behavior
4. Review PRD/ROADMAP/TASKS for future feature planning

### For Feature Development
1. All M0-M3 milestones complete - ready for post-MVP features
2. Stream operations framework ready for implementation
3. Authentication/security layer can be added
4. Import/export functionality can be built on solid foundation

### For Architecture Evolution
1. Current single-table design supports easy migration to per-namespace tables
2. RSB integration provides pathway for advanced stream processing
3. XDG compliance enables easy deployment and configuration

## 💯 **Success Criteria Met**

✅ **Core CRUD + discovery + TTL-create pass tests in isolated env**  
✅ **Correct exit codes**  
✅ **Clear errors**  
✅ **Single-binary CLI functionality**  
✅ **Deterministic behavior**  
✅ **XDG path compliance**

## 🏆 **Conclusion**

**ProntoDB MVP is COMPLETE and OPERATIONAL.** The project has successfully recovered from previous stalled development and now provides a solid foundation for future enhancement. All core functionality works as specified, tests pass, and the codebase demonstrates good RSB integration patterns for team learning.

The combination of China's knowledge documentation, working code, comprehensive tests, and RSB usage examples creates an excellent foundation for continued development and team onboarding.
