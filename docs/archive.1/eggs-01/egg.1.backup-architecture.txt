üêî CHINA'S BACKUP ARCHITECTURE EGG #1 ü•ö

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
ProntoDB Backup Implementation - Surgical Architecture Analysis

1. ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS
- RSB Pre-Dispatcher Compliant ‚úÖ
- Modular Command Structure
- XDG Path Integration
- Error Handling via Custom Enum

2. IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY
- Strengths:
  * Robust error management
  * Flexible cursor/database selection
  * Auto-incrementing backup naming
  * User-specific context support
- Weaknesses:
  * Limited to single file backup
  * No comprehensive system state preservation

3. BACKUP SCOPE ANALYSIS
- CURRENT: Database file only (Simple Copy)
- PREVIOUS: Database + Cursor Files (tar.gz)
- KEY DECISION POINT: Comprehensive vs Lightweight Backup

4. CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS
- Filename Pattern: `prontodb_<dbname>_<YYYYMMDD>[_nXX].db`
- Default Backup Location: `~/repos/zindex/cache/backup`
- Supports per-user and per-cursor backups
- Maximum 99 backups per day before error

5. ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS
- Consider adding optional tar.gz compression
- Implement cursor file tracking in backup
- Add metadata retention strategy
- Enhance backup rotation/cleanup mechanism

CONFIDENCE RATING: 4.5/5 üåü
Production Ready for Current Scope

OPEN QUESTIONS:
- Full system state backup strategy?
- Comprehensive backup retention policy?
