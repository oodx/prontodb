 🔮 FUTURE RSB-HUB INTEGRATION
====

**Current State (Temporary)**:
```toml
hub = { git = "https://github.com/oodx/hub.git", features = ["data"] }
rsb = { git = "https://github.com/oodx/rsb.git", features = ["visuals", "stdopts"] }
```

**Future State (Planned)**:
```toml
rsb = { git = "https://github.com/oodx/rsb.git", features = ["visuals", "stdopts", "hub"] }
# Hub dependencies will be forwarded through RSB automatically
```

====
 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS
====

1. **Current**: Dual dependency management (RSB + Hub)
2. **Future**: Single RSB dependency with hub forwarding
3. **Benefit**: Cleaner dependency tree, unified versioning
4. **Timeline**: When RSB integrates hub internally

====
 📋 MIGRATION IMPACT
====

**When RSB forwards hub**:
- Remove direct hub dependency from Cargo.toml
- RSB will provide hub's packages through its own features
- Imports may change from `hub::serde` to `rsb::deps::serde`
- Cleaner ecosystem with single framework dependency

**No Impact On**:
- Core architecture decisions
- Filesystem-first design
- Per-address keystore approach
- Application logic

====
 ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED
====

**For Future Maintainers**:
1. Monitor RSB releases for hub integration
2. Update ProntoDB when RSB forwards hub
3. Test migration carefully (dependency resolution)
4. Update documentation when change occurs

**Current Priority**:
- Build core modules with current clean dependencies
- Focus on architectural rebuild
- Dependency consolidation is future enhancement
