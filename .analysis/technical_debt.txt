Analyst: Meta Process v2 Implementation
Status: Initial assessment

====
 üö® HIGH PRIORITY DEBT
====

[DEBT-001] Error Handling Consistency (3 SP)
- Current: Mix of unwrap(), expect(), and Result patterns
- Target: Standardize on thiserror crate throughout
- Impact: Production reliability and debugging
- Files: src/storage.rs, src/api.rs, src/dispatcher.rs

[DEBT-002] Logging Framework (2 SP)
- Current: println! and eprintln! scattered throughout
- Target: Structured logging with tracing/log crate
- Impact: Production monitoring and debugging
- Files: Multiple src/ files

====
 üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY DEBT
====

[DEBT-003] Dependency Updates (1 SP)
- Current: Some dependencies behind latest
- Target: Update to latest stable versions
- Impact: Security and performance improvements
- Files: Cargo.toml

[DEBT-004] Code Documentation (2 SP)
- Current: Limited inline documentation
- Target: Add rustdoc comments for public APIs
- Impact: Developer experience and maintainability
- Files: src/api.rs, src/addressing.rs

[DEBT-005] Test Organization (2 SP)
- Current: Tests mixed in src/ and tests/
- Target: Consolidate testing strategy
- Impact: Test maintainability and coverage
- Files: tests/*, src/lib.rs

====
 üü¢ LOW PRIORITY DEBT
====

[DEBT-006] Binary Size Optimization (3 SP)
- Current: Release binary could be smaller
- Target: Profile-guided optimization, strip symbols
- Impact: Deployment efficiency
- Files: Cargo.toml, build scripts

[DEBT-007] CLI Argument Parsing (2 SP)
- Current: Custom RSB-based parsing
- Target: Evaluate clap integration while maintaining RSB
- Impact: User experience and maintainability
- Files: src/main.rs, src/dispatcher.rs

====
 üìä DEBT METRICS
====

Total Technical Debt: 15 Story Points
- High Priority: 5 SP (33%)
- Medium Priority: 7 SP (47%)
- Low Priority: 5 SP (20%)

Estimated Resolution Time: 2-3 sprints
Impact on Velocity: Minimal (good architecture)

====
 üéØ RECOMMENDED REMEDIATION ORDER
====

1. DEBT-002: Logging Framework (quick win)
2. DEBT-001: Error Handling (foundation)
3. DEBT-003: Dependency Updates (maintenance)
4. DEBT-004: Code Documentation (developer experience)
5. DEBT-005: Test Organization (quality)
6. DEBT-006: Binary Size (optimization)
7. DEBT-007: CLI Parsing (enhancement)

====
 ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURAL STRENGTHS
====

- RSB Framework compliance achieved
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage (16/16 passing)
- Production-ready deployment scripts
- Multi-agent isolation working correctly
- SQLite integration stable and performant

====
 üìù NOTES
====

- Overall technical debt is low for project size
- No critical architectural issues identified
- Most debt is polish and maintainability focused
- Core functionality is solid and production-ready
- Meta Process v2 will help track future debt
