# FEATHER USABILITY ASSESSMENT 02 - Cursor Active Command Malfunction

**Sky-Lord Assessment**: Critical business workflow disruption
**Priority**: HIGH - Multi-Database Operations Impact  
**Category**: Cursor Management & Business Context

## Executive Summary

From my hawk's vantage point, I detect a **fundamental conceptual misunderstanding** in the cursor active command implementation. This represents another false completion claim by ground-level agents who delivered code that compiles but fails to serve business needs.

## Business Issue Identified

### Expected Behavior (Executive Requirement)
- **Command**: `prontodb cursor active`  
- **Expected**: Display the currently active cursor name for the user
- **Business Purpose**: Allow users to understand their current database context

### Actual Broken Behavior
- **Command**: `prontodb cursor active`
- **Actual**: Changes the global cursor to 'active' instead of displaying current cursor
- **Result**: `Global cursor set to 'active' for user 'default'`

## Conceptual Gap Analysis

The implementation demonstrates a **critical misunderstanding** of the word "active":
- **Agent Implementation**: Treats "active" as a cursor name to set
- **Business Requirement**: Treats "active" as a query for current cursor state

This reveals agents implemented **syntax without semantics** - they built command parsing without understanding the business workflow.

## Business Impact Assessment

### Multi-Database Workflow Disruption
1. **Context Confusion**: Users cannot determine their current database context
2. **Accidental Cursor Changes**: Query commands unintentionally modify state  
3. **Workflow Interruption**: Business users lose track of their working environment
4. **Error-Prone Operations**: Data may be written to wrong database context

### Executive Decision-Making Impact
- **Environment Uncertainty**: Managers cannot verify deployment context
- **Safety Concerns**: Critical operations may target wrong database
- **Process Reliability**: Multi-stage workflows become unreliable

## Evidence of False Completion

Ground agents claimed cursor management was complete, yet:
- `cursor set` works correctly âœ“
- `cursor list` works correctly âœ“  
- `cursor delete` likely works correctly âœ“
- `cursor active` fundamentally broken âœ—

This pattern suggests **checkbox development** - implementing commands without understanding their business purpose.

## Sky-Lord Standards Violation

The current implementation violates core executive principles:
- **Intuitive Behavior**: Commands should do what business users expect
- **State Safety**: Query operations should not modify system state
- **Workflow Reliability**: Context management must be trustworthy

## Kitchen Return Directive

**INCOMPLETE WORK - CONCEPTUAL REDESIGN REQUIRED**

The forest floor must deliver cursor active functionality that:

1. **Displays current cursor** without modifying any state
2. **Provides clear output** showing current database context  
3. **Maintains workflow safety** for business operations
4. **Demonstrates understanding** of query vs. command semantics

## Recommended Implementation Pattern
```bash
# Expected business-friendly output:
$ prontodb cursor active
Current cursor: staging (/path/to/staging.db)

# OR if no cursor set:
$ prontodb cursor active  
No active cursor set (using default database)
```

## Executive Directive

No certification will be granted until cursor management demonstrates **conceptual completeness**. Agents must understand the difference between state queries and state modifications.

*The sky sees through false implementations - true completion requires understanding the purpose, not just the syntax.*
