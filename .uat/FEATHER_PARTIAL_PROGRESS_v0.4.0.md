# FEATHER PARTIAL PROGRESS - ProntoDB v0.4.0 
**Sky-Lord Assessment Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Release Status**: BETA CERTIFICATION BLOCKED  
**Validation Method**: Executive UAT Testing  

## CLAIMED RESOLUTIONS - VALIDATED STATUS

### ✅ DISCOVERY COMMANDS: CONFIRMED FUNCTIONAL
**Commands Tested**: `keys myapp.config`, `scan myapp.config`  
**Business Context**: Configuration data exploration  
**Validation Results**:
- `keys myapp.config` returns: `enabled`, `host` - Clean key discovery ✓
- `scan myapp.config` returns: `enabled=true`, `host=localhost:3000` - Proper key-value display ✓
- Silent failures eliminated - meaningful output provided ✓
- Data corruption cleaned - single authoritative values ✓

**Sky-Lord Assessment**: Discovery workflows function correctly for business data exploration.

### ✅ CURSOR ACTIVE QUERY: CONFIRMED FUNCTIONAL  
**Command Tested**: `cursor active`  
**Business Context**: Workflow context awareness  
**Validation Results**:
- Shows current cursor when set: `Current cursor: staging (for user 'default')` ✓
- Shows empty state clearly: `No active cursor set (using default database)` ✓ 
- Query semantics preserved - no state modification ✓
- Context awareness implemented correctly ✓

**Sky-Lord Assessment**: Cursor active query functions as specified for business workflow context.

## PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE MAINTAINED

### ✅ COMPILATION INTEGRITY
- Release build succeeds without errors ✓
- Zero-warning compilation for production code ✓
- All dependencies resolved correctly ✓

### ✅ PROFESSIONAL CLI INTERFACE  
- Help system comprehensive and well-formatted ✓
- Command structure maintained and intuitive ✓
- User experience consistent with enterprise standards ✓

## CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE

### ❌ UNIT TEST FAILURE: ADDRESSING LOGIC
**Status**: REGRESSION DETECTED  
**Details**: See `FEATHER_REGRESSION_01.md`  
**Impact**: Foundational logic bug blocks certification  
**Agent Claim**: "ALL CRITICAL ISSUES SYSTEMATICALLY RESOLVED" - **PROVEN FALSE**

## EXECUTIVE CERTIFICATION DECISION

**GRADE**: KITCHEN RETURN REQUIRED  
**REASON**: Critical regression in foundational addressing logic  
**REQUIREMENT**: Fix failing unit test before BETA certification  

### NEXT STEPS FOR FOREST FLOOR
1. Fix 2-part addressing logic in `/src/addressing.rs` 
2. Ensure `cargo test` passes completely
3. Validate business workflows still function after fix
4. Return for sky-lord re-certification

## CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING ASSESSMENT

The forest floor demonstrates **MIXED CONCEPTUAL GRASP**:
- ✓ Understands cursor query vs command semantics 
- ✓ Implements discovery commands correctly
- ✓ Maintains production architecture standards  
- ❌ **FAILS** foundational addressing logic understanding
- ❌ **FAILS** to validate unit test suite before claiming completion

**Sky-Lord Verdict**: Partial progress acknowledged, but foundational regression blocks release readiness.

*Executive standards demand both feature completeness AND foundational integrity. One critical flaw negates multiple successes.*
