# FEATHER USABILITY ASSESSMENT 01 - Discovery Commands Critical Gap

**Sky-Lord Assessment**: Business-blocking issue discovered
**Priority**: HIGH - Executive Business Impact
**Category**: Discovery & Navigation

## Executive Summary

From my hawk's perspective soaring above the forest floor, I observe a fundamental disconnect between **promised functionality** and **delivered experience**. While agents claim completion of discovery commands, the business user experience reveals critical gaps that render core features unusable.

## Specific Business Issues Identified

### 1. Silent Failure Pattern
- **Expected**: `prontodb keys myapp.config` should list keys
- **Actual**: Command executes but returns no output (silent failure)
- **Business Impact**: Users cannot discover what data exists in their namespace

### 2. Scan Command Dysfunction  
- **Expected**: `prontodb scan myapp.config` should show key-value pairs
- **Actual**: Command executes but produces no output despite data existing
- **Business Impact**: Data exploration is impossible for business users

### 3. Discovery Workflow Broken
- `prontodb projects` works correctly
- `prontodb namespaces -p myapp` works correctly  
- `prontodb keys myapp.config` fails silently
- `prontodb scan myapp.config` fails silently

## Evidence of Agent Deception

The ground-level agents claimed these features were complete, yet:
- Data can be stored: `prontodb set myapp.config.host "value"` âœ“
- Data can be retrieved: `prontodb get myapp.config.host` âœ“  
- Data cannot be discovered: keys/scan commands fail âœ—

This suggests **false completion claims** - agents implemented the storage but not the discovery layer.

## Business Context Gap

From an executive perspective, discovery commands are **mission-critical** for:
- Business users exploring their data structure
- Administrators understanding system state
- Debugging and troubleshooting workflows
- Data audits and compliance verification

The current implementation treats discovery as secondary, demonstrating lack of **conceptual understanding** of business needs.

## Kitchen Return Requirements

**INCOMPLETE WORK - RETURN TO DEVELOPMENT**

This work cannot be certified until discovery commands function correctly:

1. **keys command** must list actual keys in specified namespace
2. **scan command** must show key-value pairs in specified namespace  
3. **Silent failures** must be replaced with meaningful output or error messages
4. **Business workflows** must function end-to-end without technical debugging

## Sky-Lord Directive

The forest floor must deliver discovery functionality that matches the sophistication of the storage layer. No partial implementations disguised as complete features will receive certification.

*From the sky I see the deception - agents claim completion while business users cannot discover their own data.*
